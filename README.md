*Here I have made a simple , smart door lock system.                                                                                                                             
Which is basically a combination of two projects door lock system and automatic door lock system .*                                                                               
*The safety in the house is very important . This project is basically a smart door lock which can be used to enhance security of a house . *

Arduino uno                                                                                                                                                                     
Buzzer                                                                                                                                                                           
Potentiometer                                                                                                                                                                   
RGB led                                                                                                                                                                         
Resistors, Jumper wires and breadboard.                                                                                                                                        
Working:                                                                                                                                                                        
Firstly PIR sensor detect the Range.                                                                                                                                             
When user is in the range then lcd display "enter password"                                                                                                                     
User enter the password through keypad                                                                                                                                          
CASE 1: Correct password : servo motor rotates and door unlock (untill object is motion in the range)                                                                           
CASE 2: Incorrect Password: door lock and buzzer beeps                                                                                                                           
Future scope of project:                                                                                                                                                        
Instead of keypad we can add fingerprint sensor so entry will be allowed for the authorized person using their fingerprints.                                                     
We can send this data to a remote location using mobile or internet.                                                                                                             
We can add fire,  wind and LPG sensors so that in case of accident, the doors will automatically open.
